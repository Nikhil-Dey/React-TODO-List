# To-Do List Application

A simple, interactive To-Do List application built using React. This project allows users to add, mark, filter, edit, and remove tasks. It is designed as a beginner-friendly project to learn React basics like state management, event handling, and conditional rendering.

## Features

- **Add Tasks**: Users can add new tasks by entering text in the input field and clicking the "Submit" button.
- **Mark Tasks as Completed**: Users can mark tasks as completed using the checkbox next to each task.
- **Remove Tasks**: Each task has a "Remove" button to delete it from the list.
- **Filter Tasks**: Filter tasks by "All", "Completed", or "Uncompleted" using the filter buttons.
- **Edit Tasks**: Users can edit an existing task by clicking the "Edit" button, modifying the text, and saving the changes.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **CSS**: Styling for the application.
